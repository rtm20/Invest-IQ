      executiveSummary: `EcoTech Solutions represents a compelling investment opportunity in the rapidly expanding waste management technology sector. Founded by Sarah Chen (ex-Tesla) and Marcus Rodriguez (ex-Microsoft), the company has developed an AI-powered platform that optimizes waste management and recycling processes for enterprise clients.

The business demonstrates strong early traction with $3.2M in ARR, 156 customers, and 245% revenue growth rate. Operating in a $127B total addressable market with 18.5% annual growth, EcoTech has captured meaningful market share while maintaining healthy unit economics (78% gross margins).

Key investment highlights include exceptional founder-market fit, proven product-market fit, defensible AI technology, and significant secular tailwinds from increasing ESG focus. The founding team's track record at Tesla and Microsoft provides credibility and execution capability.

Primary risks include regulatory complexity in the waste management industry and competitive pressure from well-funded incumbents. However, the company's AI-driven differentiation and early market leadership position mitigate these concerns.

Recommendation: INVEST at $28M valuation with $3.5M check size. The combination of strong team, large market, proven traction, and sustainable competitive advantages creates an attractive risk-adjusted return profile for growth-stage investors.`,
