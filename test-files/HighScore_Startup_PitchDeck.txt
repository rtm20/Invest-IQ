COMPANY OVERVIEW
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Company Name: CloudShift AI
Industry: Enterprise SaaS / Cloud Infrastructure / AI/ML
Stage: Series B
Founded: January 2021
Location: Palo Alto, California
Website: www.cloudshift.ai

Mission: Automate enterprise cloud migration and optimization using AI, 
reducing costs by 40% and migration time from 18 months to 6 weeks.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                              THE PROBLEM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ENTERPRISE CLOUD MIGRATION IS BROKEN:

• 87% of enterprises migrating to cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)
• Average migration takes 18-24 months and costs $2.5M per company
• 62% of migrations fail or go over budget by 200%+
• Manual process requires 20+ consultants at $200/hour
• Post-migration cloud costs 35% higher than projected
• Companies waste $17B annually on inefficient cloud spending

SPECIFIC PAIN POINTS:
1. Manual application discovery takes 4-6 months
2. Dependency mapping errors cause downtime (avg: $300K/incident)
3. Cloud resource over-provisioning wastes 30-40% of spend
4. No visibility into optimization opportunities post-migration
5. Vendor lock-in limits multi-cloud strategies

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
